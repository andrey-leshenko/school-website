school-website
==============

This project is done as part of learning ASPX website development.

The goal of the project is to create a functional website with registration, and administration capabilities. The user data is stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database, with the password hashed using Sha1.

NOTE:
Because of the project's requirements, some parts of the code-base aren't really maintainable.
